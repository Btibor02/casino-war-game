# Casino War

The game is played with a standard 52 card deck. The cards are ranked in the same way that cards in poker games are ranked, with aces being the highest cards.

One card each is dealt to an AI and to a player. If the player's card is higher, they win the wager they bet. However, if the AI's card is higher, the player loses their bet.

A tie occurs when the ai and the player each have cards of the same rank. In a tie situation, the player has two options:

The player can surrender, in which case the player loses half the bet.  
The player can go to war, in which case the player must double their stake.

If the player continues play in view of a tie, the computer burns (discards) three cards before dealing each of them an additional card. If the player's card is ranked higher than the AI's, then the player wins the amount of their original wager only. If the Ai's card is ranked higher than the player's, the player loses their (doubled) wager.
